# Clustering and Dimensionality-Reduction
- k-means implements K-means clustering for a set of input vectors, and an initial set of cluster centers
- init_centers implements K-Means++ center initialization algorithm for a set of input vectors, and an initial set of cluster centers
- datasetPCA takes an input data set, computes the mean of the data vectors, and then finds the PCA eigenvectors for the covariance matrix to obtain a low-dimensional representation of the data
